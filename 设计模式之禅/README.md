# SOLID原则

- Single responsibility principle
  - A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
- Open–closed principle
    - "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- Liskov substitution principle
    - "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.
- Interface segregation principle
    - "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
- Dependency inversion principle
    - One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.



- Law of Memeter
  - Each unit should have only limited knowledge about other units: only units "closely" related to the current unit.
  - Each unit should only talk to its friends; don't talk to strangers.
  - Only talk to your immediate friends.
