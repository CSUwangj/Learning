application-order:

```scheme
(test 0 (p))

(test 0 (p))

(test 0 (p))
loop to the end of world to expand (p) 
```

normal-order:

```scheme
(test 0 (p))

(if (= 0 0)
    0
    (p))

(if #t 0 (p))

0
```

run out of memory.

Because compiler use application-order evaluation, and new-if is a function, so both parameters will be evaluated, which lead to infinite recursion.

code to show this difference:

```scheme
=> (if #t (display "good") (display "bad"))
good
=> (new-if #t (display "good") (display "bad"))
badgood
```

It's obvious why tiny number get wrong square root. For large number, as we all know float point number have a accuracy limit, in practice, we always use IEEE Standard 754. When difference is so large that standard dones't support us to express such small change on large number, which lead to unchanged large number.

**Proof.** Let $P(n)$ be the statement $f(n)=\frac{\phi ^n-\psi ^n}{\sqrt{5}}$ where $f(n)=\left\{\begin{matrix}0,n=0\\1,n=1\\f(n-1)+f(n-1),n>1\\\end{matrix}\right. , \phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}, \psi = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$. We give a proof by induction on $n$.

*Base case:* $P(0)$„ÄÅ$P(1)$ is easily seen to be true: 
$$0=\frac{\phi ^0-\psi ^0}{\sqrt{5}}$$
$$1=\frac{\phi ^1-\psi ^1}{\sqrt{5}}$$

*Inductive step:* Show that for any $k \geq 0$ that if $P(k)$ and $P(k+1)$ holds, then $P(k+2)$ also holds. This can be done as follows.

Assume the induction hypothsis that $P(k)$ and $P(k+1)$ is true (for some arbitrary value of $k \geq 0$). It must then be shown that $P(k+2)$ is true, that is:
$$f(k+2)=\frac{\phi ^{k+2}-\psi ^{k+2}}{\sqrt{5}}$$
Using the computation rule and induction hypothesis, the left-hand side can be equated to:
$$f(k)+f(k+1)$$
$$\frac{\phi ^{k}-\psi ^{k}}{\sqrt{5}}+\frac{\phi ^{k+1}-\psi ^{k+1}}{\sqrt{5}}$$
Algebraically, we have that:
$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\phi ^{k}-\psi ^{k}}{\sqrt{5}}+\frac{\phi ^{k+1}-\psi ^{k+1}}{\sqrt{5}} &=\frac{\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\phi^k + \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\psi ^k}{\sqrt{5}}\\&=\frac{\phi ^{k+2}-\psi ^{k+2}}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{aligned}$$
which shows that $P(k+2)$ indeed holds.

---

And it's obvious that $|1-\sqrt{5}|<2$, so $\lim_{x\to\inf}\psi ^x=0.$ Which means $Fib(n)$ is the closest integer to $\frac{\phi ^n}{\sqrt{5}}$.
